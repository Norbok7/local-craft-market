# E-Commerce Platform Backend

Welcome to our E-Commerce platform backend repository! This Rails application serves as the backbone for our platform, handling user authentication, product listings, order management, and more.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to organize different aspects of the platform:

- User management
- Artisan management
- Product listings
- Order management
- Review management

Each module consists of models, controllers, and serializers tailored to its specific functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `bundle install`.
4. Set up the database with `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.
5. Start the Rails server with `rails server`.
6. Ensure the frontend is configured to communicate with the backend APIs.

## API Endpoints

- The backend exposes RESTful APIs for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Endpoints also handle product listings, order placement, review submission, and more.

## Database Schema

- The database schema is designed to support relationships between users, artisans, products, orders, and reviews.
- Refer to the schema file for details on tables and their associations.

## Authentication and Authorization

- User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Authorization logic restricts access to certain routes and actions based on user roles.

<!-- ## Admin Dashboard in progress not deployed -->

<!-- - An admin dashboard provides insights into platform activity, allowing administrators to manage users, products, orders, and reviews. -->
